Organize a team for a long project is always very tricky: the first couple of weeks goes by smoothly, but then big and small unexpected problems start to pile up and everything get just swallowed by chaos.
What I really like in the agile methodology is that it gives you a framework to help you adjust and react to all the unaccounted things that happen when working on a project.
The agile methodology should be agile too and be adjusted by a team to meet its specific needs.
Here a couple of tips that can be helpful to improve your methodology 

# 1) Grooming:
One key feature is to be always prepared, to manage potential blocker before they become real blockers.
During a sprint can be very useful to schedule a meeting to review the stories in the backlog: are them too vague, is something missing to be able to start working on them (information, assets...)?


# 2) Estimation reviews:
At the end of each sprint, you should check what worked and what went wrong, especially about the estimation: were them too low or too high? Why? Did someone spend hours on tasks that were not scheduled (deploy, local environment setup, researches about a new library to include...)? There are other things that are slowing down the development process that has not been yet considered (pair programming, training of a new team member...)

_Pro tip:_
_Track the time you spend on every task, take notes when some unexpected problem makes you spend more time than planned: it the only way to improve in your estimate_


# 3) Avoid useless meetings:
Meetings are boring and sometimes are just a waste of time.
Replacing the daily scrum where everybody writes everyday tasks done the previous day, task scheduled for the current day, blockers and any suggestion to review during the sprint review can be a great technique to reduce time waste.
Try to combine multiple points for a single meeting: if the client answer 1 question every day, do a weekly meeting to discuss all the previous answers instead of doing a small daily meeting.
