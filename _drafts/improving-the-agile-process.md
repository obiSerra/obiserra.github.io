What I really like in the agile methodology Is that it gives you a framework to help you adjust and react to all the unaccounted things that happen when working on a project.
Recently I came across a few things that really help.


Grooming:
Meetings to review the stories scheduled for future sprints. If they are too vague, something is missing to be able to start working on them (information, assets...)

Estimation reviews:
At the end of each sprint, you should check what worked and what went wrong, especially about the estimation: were them too low or too high? Did someone spend hours on tasks that were not scheduled?

Pro tip:
Track the time you spend on every task, take notes when some unexpected problem makes you spend more time than planned; it the only way to improve in your estimate


Avoid useless meetings:
Meetings are boring and sometimes are just a waste of time.
Replacing the daily scrum where everybody writes everyday tasks done the previous day, task scheduled for the current day, blockers and any suggestion to review during the sprint review can be a great technique to reduce time waste
