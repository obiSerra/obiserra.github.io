I work as a senior software engineer at [Etiqa](https://etiqa.it/), a small but enlighten company in northern Italy.

I have two kids Matteo and Tommaso.

I have not much spare time and too many interests; some of them are:
listen to podcasts and sci-fi audiobooks, watching educational and culinary videos on YouTube, drinking and brewing beer, cooking and eating, playing with electronics and physical computing.

I am an atheist, a rationalist and strongly against any discrimination of race, gender, sexual orientation.
